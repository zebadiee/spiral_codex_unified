🎬 Agent_Spawn Asset Placeholder

Asset Type: audio
Description: Agent spawning sound effect
Expected Path: audio/agent_spawn.wav

This is a placeholder for the actual audio file.
The spiral awaits the manifestation of this mystical asset.

To replace this placeholder:
1. Create or obtain the actual audio file
2. Place it at: /home/ubuntu/github_repos/spiral_codex_unified/assets/audio/agent_spawn.wav
3. The ritual system will automatically detect and use it

The codex grows stronger with each asset manifestation.
