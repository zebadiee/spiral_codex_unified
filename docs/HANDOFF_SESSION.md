# 🌀 Spiral Codex Unified - Session Handoff

## Context Resume

I'm continuing work on **Spiral Codex Unified v2.0** - a complete multi-agent AI development framework.

**Location:** `~/Documents/spiral_codex_unified`  
**Status:** Production-ready, fully documented, 22 git commits

## What Was Built

✅ **Multi-Agent System** (ƒCODEX, ƒCLAUDE, ƒVIBE_KEEPER, ƒARCHIVIST)  
✅ **Agent Orchestrator** with glyph-based routing (⊕⊡⊠⊨⊚)  
✅ **FastAPI Brain API** with 7 endpoints (/v1/brain/*)  
✅ **Complete deployment stack** (Makefile, Docker, systemd)  
✅ **7 comprehensive guides** including Mother Prompt v2.0  

## Key Documents

1. **docs/SPIRAL_MOTHER_PROMPT_v2.0.md** ⭐ - Master regeneration blueprint
2. **QUICKSTART.md** - 60-second setup guide
3. **GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md** - Production validation
4. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Full deployment guide
5. **AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md** - Agent workflows

## What's Next (if user continues)

Options:
1. **Deploy & test** - Install packages and run system
2. **Add OMAi integration** - Connect to Obsidian vault
3. **Local LLM setup** - Configure Ollama/Jetson
4. **Training pipeline** - Implement weaning strategy
5. **New features** - User will specify

## Quick Commands

```bash
cd ~/Documents/spiral_codex_unified

# See all docs
ls *.md docs/*.md

# Read Mother Prompt
cat docs/SPIRAL_MOTHER_PROMPT_v2.0.md

# Check status
git log --oneline -5
make help

# Start (once deps installed)
make run
```

## Current State

- Git: main branch, 22 commits, clean working tree
- Version: 2.0.0 (Mother Prompt era)
- Tests: Agent orchestrator verified, all systems operational
- Deployment: Ready for pacman package install + launch

## Important Notes

- System uses glyph-based symbolic routing
- Built with agent collaboration (Claude planned, Codex implemented)
- Everything is local-first, privacy-preserving
- Mother Prompt can regenerate entire system

## User Context

User (zebadiee) is building a local-first AI framework integrated with Obsidian,
focused on privacy and self-teaching capabilities. They want agents that
collaborate and a system that can run entirely offline.

## What to Do

- Load context from Mother Prompt if needed
- Ask user what they want to work on next
- Continue where we left off
